# Credit-Card-Dashboard
PowerBi Dashboard

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit card customer and transaction data to uncover spending patterns and business insights.
Using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, I built an interactive dashboard that provides a clear view of customer behavior, revenue trends, and card performance.

Dataset
The dataset includes information about:
Customers: Age, gender, education, income group, marital status, dependents, and state
Transactions: Date, card type (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum), spending category (Bills, Entertainment, Travel, etc.), amount, and interest

Steps Followed:
1. Cleaned and merged CSV files using SQL for consistency and accuracy
2. Loaded processed data into Power BI and built relationships between tables
3. Created key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, income, interest, and transactions
4. Designed interactive visuals and filters to explore insights by card type, gender, income level, and quarter

Key Insights
Platinum and Gold cardholders generated the highest revenue
Bills and Entertainment were the top spending categories
Married and middle-income customers showed higher transaction volumes
Q4 recorded the strongest performance, indicating seasonal trends

Outcome
This project improved my understanding of SQL–Power BI integration and helped me practice transforming raw financial data into meaningful insights.
In the future, I plan to extend it with predictive analysis to forecast spending behavior.
